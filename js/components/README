types of entities:
	- Renderer
		* instances a reference to a transform component
		* instances a reference to a view component
	- Mesh
		* instances a reference to a transform component
		* instances a reference to a material instance

use this to build other components like:
	- Transform
		* local to world
	- View
		* projection matrix
		implicitly -> gets reference to 
		transformation matrix
	- Material Instance
		* reference to a w_shader
		

have a component that analyses the shader after instance
passes through the shader and identifies characteristics
(automatically associated the transformation matrix with a gpu buffer)

breadth first traversal to display matrices.
	-> every object in the scene graph MUST have a transformation matrix
therefore we don't need to check for it, just simply grab it:
